    <h1>HI! I AM SULAV</h1>
    <p>I am an Engineer. I thrive to simplify things easily.<bR><br>I started with my only purpose in life, try to provide 'a' solution to 'a' problem. 'a', as I always believe there is a single best solution to a particular problem.
    Engineering equipped me the ability to relate Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics of any situation. Since then, solving problems has been challenging-fun game. <br><br>
  I am highly focused to contribute for rapid development of renewable energy system. My everyday search for the internet is: <span class="bigger" style="color: rgba(34, 177, 76, 0.99);">Even though the need for energy is common in all of us, how is it possible that not any one of us has still developed the bestest way to generate one? Why is the faulty one still being considered for our use? Is it the engineering complexity of these systems or is it the finance part?</span><br>I have a dream to eliminate each of the faults associated with these systems. When the physics of most abundant solar power, unavoidable waste power, inconsumable water power, lively air power, and unexplored inner-earth power excels with the power of chemistry, the math of an engineer shows its influence, to make the best of the system.

          <h5>Design and Fabrication of Buoyancy Assisted Trash Collector.</h5>
          <p>
            Problem Statement: We observed that the major pollutant for the water resources were suspended solid objects. Cleaning of large pond and lake was tedious and almost impossible to carryout. Because of this, the purpose of these water resources were not attained. It lost its natural beauty as well as its ability to support living beings. <br> We, a team of four, started with a vision to fabricate a machine capable to clean those floating debries. Initially, we decided to use completely new supplies for the fabrication of the machine. But, later on we concluded to construct it using the discarded material in our Campus junkyard.<br>
            We won <u>Best Application Award</u> for the project in National Level Design Competition. We completely relied on our numerical calculation to test the machine on a pool of water.

          <h5>Comparitive Study of Backward Curved Vane Plug Fan for Industrial Use.</h5>
          <p> Problem Statement: Many industry uses the backward curved fan for various application. Depending upon the number of vanes,  speed of rotation and outer diameter, the application area of the fan varied. ANSYS CFX simulations were performed. 2 different outer diameter was studied. Outer diameter was altered to determine the change in outlet pressure. Later, other two parameter were determined which could restore the outlet pressure to original value.<br>
          Result: 542mm outer diameter, 7 vanes and 250 rpm created same pressure effect as 270 mm outer diameter, 7 vanes and 1338 rpm, and 270 mm outer diameter, 12 vanes and 250 rpm.
          <br>This project was submitted for partial fulfillment of requirement in course of Turbo Machinery.

          <h5>Design of Outer Conveyor System to CFC Filler by Merging two Stations at Surya Nepal Factory.</h5>
          <p>
          Problem Statement: The existing FOCKE 20SC outer conveyor line was kept dormant as its CFC filler
          machine was isolated, requiring a separate set of workers to operate on the filler machine. This
          not only increased labor costs but also increases material handling costs. A convenient solution was
          provided to merge the existing FOCKE 20SC outer conveyor with the SASIB 20SC outer
          conveyor in to a single plains CFC filler machine such that the former problems were eradicated.<br>
          Mathematical modeling of the problem to identify the shortest and effiecient route, automation, preparation of BoQ and cost estimation, structural design of the conveyor system, SWOT analysis of alternatives, and selection of the best solution was performed.<br>  
          Result: Proposed design solution of outer conveyor for FOCKE 20SC was a length of
          1143±5 cm, before the merge point with the existing SASIB 20SC outer conveyor line. The buffer
          time for this solution was 3 minutes 40 seconds for FOCKE 20SC machine while 5 minutes 52 seconds
          for SASIB 20SC. This solution simplified the outer conveying system for FOCKE 20SC, but required
          some modification to the existing RSFT outer conveyor line.

        <h5>Design and simulation of Francis Turbine Runner for Betan Karnali Hydroelectric Project for original and reduced head condition.</h5>
        <p>
        Problem Statement: Betan Karnali
        Hydroelectric Project harness 688MW of power from
        karnali river. Just downstream of the project, there
        is another expected hydropower construction of
        Karnali Chisapani Multipurpose Project. It is
        foreseen that the BKHEP experiences variation of net
        head from 90.82 m and to 49.16 m due to increment
        in tail water level after the construction of Karnali
        Chisapani Multipurpose Project downstream.
        The hydraulic efficiency of a turbine will definitely
        not be optimum when the runner designed for initial net head condition is used for reduced head condition. Another important consideration was that the outer diameter should not be allowed change with the change in design variables. If, the outer diameter of the runner changes then the powerhouse spacing (majorly) and the design of auxuliary system changes. This might indicate the possibility for construction of new hydropower, which will be highly expensive.<br>
        We decided to evaluate the performance of the runner blade under reduced head condition, and iterate the design to obtain the blade profile that provided highest hydraulic efficiency, with out changing the outer diameter of the runner.<br>
        Result:The simulation carried out for net head of 90.82 m at
        flow rate 92.37 m
        3/s and speed 187.5 rpm resulted in
        hydraulic efficiency of 94.19% at guidevane opening
        angle of 18.5°. When the same runner is used at reduced net head of 49.16 m with same flow rate
        92.37 m
        3/s and speed of 187.5 rpm, hydraulic
        efficiency of 86.33% is obtained at guidevane opening
        angle of 31°. Further simulations carried out by
        varying blade profile resulted gain in hydraulic
        efficiency. The hydraulic efficiency of 90.94 % was
        achieved for lean angle +5°at guidevane opening of
        30°. Thus, the replacement runner with the lean angle
        +5°having equal diameter as previous can be done
        with < 5% decrement in efficiency. This allowed
        replacement of the runner without changing other
        hydropower components which is beneficial from
        financial perspective.

        <h5>Study of Thin Bio- Film Production for Use as a Transparent,Study of Thin Bio- Film Production for Use as a Transparent, Hydrophobic, Self-Cleaning Cover for Solar Panels.
        </h5>
        <p>
          Problem Statement: One of the most severe factors for the PV degradation and performance reduction is solar soiling. Solar soiling is the deposition of opaque or semi-transparent particle/layer on Solar PV irradiation surface which preclude the overall photon-energy transmission. There are autonomous or semi-autonomous systems available in the market, for periodic cleaning which is energy consuming. Also, with time, there is a record of people abandoning because of difficulty of maintenance.Bio-chemically synthesized hydrophobic thin films can render solutions to solar soiling. These thin films could replace the solar panel glasses in the future with necessary improvements and possible alterations. <br>
          Result: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) blended with Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) with surface modification by Poly butylene terephthalate (PBT) and powdered silica was used to produce a transparent, hydrophobic film which could act as a self-cleaning cover for soiling prone solar panels. The film exhibited an average transmittance of 92.18% of the incident light in the solar PV working spectra (420nm-700nm). Hydrophobicity was quantified by the water contact angle (WCA) which was an average of 87.25°. The film was durable to photocatalytic and hydrolytic decay but further research is warranted before rendering the film suitable for use as a protective cover for solar panels.

        <h5>Study of Optimization of Aircraft Separation using the Time Based Separation at TIA, Nepal.
        </h5>
        <p>
         Problem Statement: The Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) uses the conventional distance-based separation minima for
          separation of two consecutive aircraft in approach and a basic Time-based separation (TBS) for aircraft in open airspace. This method of time based seperation does not take wind conditions, and its relation to dissipation of wave vortices in to account. Thus, the method does not depend on real time condition to announce seperation to be maintaned betweeen the aircraft.<br>
          The possibility of saving time by switching from the Distanced Based Separation (DBS) system to a fully Enhanced Time
Based Separation (ETBS) can improve TIA’s approach procedure. We focused on a study of the comparative
analysis between the DBS and the ETBS system for TIA, using Monte-Carlo simulation-based upon various parameters
that affect separation between the aircraft. The preliminary setup includes random number mapping for weight class of the
plane, wind speed, approach speed, and wind direction in MS Excel. An average daily time lag of 79 minutes was observed between DBS and TBS. Hence,
implementation of the ETBS system can save TIA almost 20 days of operation annually.
